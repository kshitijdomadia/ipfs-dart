# IPFS Dart Prototype

This Flutter project aims at sending and receiving text to and from IPFS (In JSON specifically). It makes use of the Infura API for IPFS.

## Getting Started

The prototype focuses on 2 things specifically. The text entered and the hash. 

Steps:

1. Enter the text in the text field.
2. Click the send button. The app receives the hash as a response.
3. Click receive button to receive the same text you had entered from IPFS using the hash that was generated when you first sent the data.
4. The received data can be easily manipulated to display fields that you like as it will be in the JSON format.
